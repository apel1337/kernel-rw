# Kernelmode R/W Memory Driver
* Simple ring 0 driver using ioctl as communication to r/w protected process memory
* Im currently also selling Private & Fully undetected version of this driver which properly hides itself, doesnt cause any NMIÂ´s and works on all kernelmode anticheats including FaceIT and VGK
* To purchase it dm me on telegram -> @MmCopyMemory

## Description
* This is NOT usable in modern anticheats because of very common detection vectors & flags ... memcpy, NMI Callbacks ETC.
